(Former [next-impl-cache-in-memory](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-impl-cache-in-memory))

Base cacheHandler for next.js, which cache data in-memory

## Installation

**Using npm:**
```sh npm2yarn copy
npm i @nimpl/cache-in-memory
```

## Usage

You can use `cacheHandler` by specifying the path to it in the application configuration:

```js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
    cacheMaxMemorySize: 0,
    cacheHandler: require.resolve('@nimpl/cache-in-memory'),
};
```

However, it is recommended to use it together with [@nimpl/cache-adapter](https://nimpl.dev/cache-adapter). 
The package will allow you to expand the capabilities of `cacheHandler` and also reuse the cache between different application instances.

## Examples
